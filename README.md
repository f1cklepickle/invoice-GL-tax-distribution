This program is designed to organize, label, and total invoices based on the assigned GL-category. The program will get the total and subtotal of the invoice and determine the tax amount based on those inputs. It will ask for each item's GL-code and $ total. Then it will organize the items into categories by GL-code and sum $ totals. The program will then, evenly distribute the tax amount based on each category's percentage of the subtotal. Finally, it will check that the total equals all category $ totals plus tax distributions. This exercise is mainly intended to improve my Javascript, CSS, and, HTML skills, but it will hopefully improve my productivity at work as well!   # invoice-GL-tax-distribution
